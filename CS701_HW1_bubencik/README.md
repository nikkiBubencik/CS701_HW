# Homework 1 – HTML5 Canvas and SVG Projects
This repository contains three interactive web-based projects using the HTML5 Canvas and SVG. These projects were developed as part of a class assignment and demonstrate key concepts in graphics programming, interactivity, and animation using JavaScript.

## [Part 1 – BullsEye Pattern Generator](./part1_bullsEye/bullsEye.html)
### Overview
This project generates a bullseye pattern of concentric circles on a 400x400 canvas. The circles alternate between red and blue, and users can adjust the band thickness using a slider.

### Features
- Canvas size: 400 x 400

- Band width slider: 5–50px (step 5), default 25

- Alternating circle colors: Red and Blue

- Optional delay: 1500ms between each ring when "Delay" is checked


## [Part 2 – Bouncing Ball Animation](./part2_animation/animation.html)
### Overview
A bouncing ball animation that moves horizontally across a canvas. When it hits the edge, it falls to the next line, changes color, and continues in the opposite direction. The animation resets after reaching the bottom.

### Features
- Ball movement in a zigzag pattern

- Color changes after each bounce

- Resets when reaching the bottom of the canvas

- Adjustable ball speed via slider


## [Part 3 – SVG Animation](./part3_svg/part2.html)
### Overview
This project uses the HTML5 SVG to animate a grouped SVG element composed of three ellipses and a text label. The animation uses the <defs> and <use> elements to reuse SVG components efficiently.

### Features
- SVG area size: 500 x 500

- Uses <defs> to define a reusable group with ellipses and text

- Animated movement of the group using JavaScript

- Demonstrates animation principles with SVG DOM manipulation
